## What Is CEF?

The Common Event Format (CEF) is a standardised log format designed for
interoperability between security products. Originally developed by
ArcSight (now part of OpenText), CEF is widely supported by SIEM
platforms including Splunk, ArcSight, IBM QRadar, OpenSearch, and
many others.

CEF provides a structured format that SIEM platforms can parse without
custom configuration. Where JSON requires each SIEM to be configured
with field mappings, CEF uses a well-known schema that SIEM platforms
understand out of the box.

## Format Structure

A CEF message is a single line with a fixed header and a variable
extension section:

```
CEF:0|Vendor|Product|Version|EventType|Description|Severity|Extensions
```

| Part | Example | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `CEF:0` | `CEF:0` | Format identifier and version |
| Vendor | `MyCompany` | Organisation producing the events |
| Product | `MyApp` | Application name |
| Version | `1.0` | Application version |
| EventType | `user_create` | Audit event type identifier |
| Description | `A new user account was created` | Human-readable description (from taxonomy) |
| Severity | `3` | Event severity (0-10 scale) |
| Extensions | `suser=alice outcome=success` | Key=value pairs with event data |

### Example Output

```
CEF:0|MyCompany|MyApp|1.0|user_create|A new user account was created|3|rt=1704067200000 act=user_create suser=alice outcome=success cat=write
CEF:0|MyCompany|MyApp|1.0|auth_failure|An authentication attempt failed|8|rt=1704067200000 act=auth_failure suser=unknown outcome=failure reason=invalid_credentials cat=security
```

> 💡 The severity `|3|` and `|8|` come from the taxonomy's category-level severity settings
> (e.g., `write: severity: 3`, `security: severity: 8`). The default category severity is 5
> when not explicitly set.
>
> The `cat` extension (ArcSight `deviceEventCategory`) is appended automatically when the
> event belongs to a category. See [Taxonomy: Event Category](taxonomy-validation.md#event-category-in-output).

## CEF vs JSON

| Aspect | CEF | JSON |
|--------|-----|------|
| **Primary use** | SIEM integration | Log aggregation, custom analytics |
| **Parsing** | SIEM-native — no custom field mapping | Requires per-SIEM field configuration |
| **Severity** | Built into the header (0-10 scale) | Just another field |
| **Description** | Built into the header | Not standard |
| **Readability** | Structured but compact | Human-readable |
| **Schema** | Well-known extension keys (suser, src, etc.) | Application-defined |
| **Best for** | Security operations, compliance reporting | Developer debugging, custom pipelines |

Use CEF when your events are consumed by a SIEM. Use JSON when events
go to log aggregators (ELK, Datadog) or custom analytics pipelines.
You can use both simultaneously — audit supports per-output
formatter overrides.

## Field Mapping

audit maps audit field names to standard CEF extension keys:

| Audit Field | CEF Extension Key | CEF Meaning |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `actor_id` | `suser` | Source user |
| `actor_uid` | `suid` | Source user ID |
| `role` | `spriv` | Source user privileges |
| `target_id` | `duser` | Destination user |
| `target_uid` | `duid` | Destination user ID |
| `target_role` | `dpriv` | Destination privileges |
| `source_ip` | `src` | Source IP address |
| `source_host` | `shost` | Source hostname |
| `source_port` | `spt` | Source port |
| `dest_ip` | `dst` | Destination IP |
| `dest_host` | `dhost` | Destination hostname |
| `dest_port` | `dpt` | Destination port |
| `protocol` | `app` | Application protocol |
| `transport` | `proto` | Transport protocol |
| `request_id` | `externalId` | External identifier |
| `user_agent` | `requestClientApplication` | Client application |
| `referrer` | `requestContext` | Request context / referrer |
| `method` | `requestMethod` | HTTP method |
| `path` | `request` | Request path |
| `outcome` | `outcome` | Event outcome |
| `reason` | `reason` | Event reason |
| `message` | `msg` | Human-readable message |
| `start_time` | `start` | Start time |
| `end_time` | `end` | End time |
| `file_name` | `fname` | File name |
| `file_path` | `filePath` | File path |
| `file_hash` | `fileHash` | File hash |
| `file_size` | `fsize` | File size |

Framework extensions are always present (not configurable via `FieldMapping`):

| Framework Field | CEF Extension Key | Description |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| timestamp | `rt` | Receipt time (Unix milliseconds) |
| event_type | `act` | Device action |
| duration_ms | `cn1` / `cn1Label` | Duration in ms / label "durationMs" (middleware events only) |
| app_name | `deviceProcessName` | Application name (required at construction) |
| host | `dvchost` | Device hostname (required at construction) |
| timezone | `dtz` | Device timezone (always populated) |
| pid | `dvcpid` | Device process ID (always present) |
| event_category | `cat` | Event category (when categorised) |

Custom field mappings can override the defaults via `CEFFormatter.FieldMapping`.
See [`DefaultCEFFieldMapping`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/axonops/audit#DefaultCEFFieldMapping)
for the complete default mapping.

## Severity Levels

CEF uses a 0-10 severity scale. Choose severity levels based on the
operational response each event should trigger:

| Severity | Label | When to Use | Example Events |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 0 | Informational | Routine operations, no action needed | `config_read`, `health_check` |
| 1-2 | Low | Normal activity worth recording | `item_list`, `user_read` |
| 3-4 | Medium | State-changing operations | `user_create`, `item_update` |
| 5 | Default | Standard audit events (if no severity set) | Any event without explicit severity |
| 6-7 | High | Security-relevant or admin operations | `config_change`, `role_assign` |
| 8-9 | Critical | Security incidents, failed access | `auth_failure`, `access_denied` |
| 10 | Emergency | Immediate response required | `data_breach`, `system_compromise` |

### Severity Resolution

Severity is resolved in this order:

1. **Per-event severity** — `severity: 9` on the event definition overrides everything
2. **Per-category severity** — `severity: 8` on the category applies to all events in that category
3. **Default** — `5` if neither is set

Severity is pre-computed at taxonomy registration time — there is no
per-event runtime cost.

### Severity in Taxonomy YAML

```yaml
categories:
  security:
    severity: 8              # all security events default to 8
    events: [auth_failure, auth_success]

events:
  auth_failure:
    severity: 9              # override: auth failures are more severe
    fields:
      outcome: { required: true }
```

## Configuration

### YAML (recommended)

```yaml
outputs:
  siem_log:
    type: file
    file:
      path: "/var/log/audit/cef.log"
    formatter:
      type: cef
      vendor: "MyCompany"
      product: "MyApp"
      version: "1.0"
```

### Programmatic

```go
cef := &audit.CEFFormatter{
    Vendor:  "MyCompany",
    Product: "MyApp",
    Version: "1.0",
}
```

## Escaping and Security

CEF escaping follows the standard specification with different rules
for headers and extension values:

- **Header fields** (vendor, product, version, event type, description):
  pipes (`|`) and backslashes are escaped; newlines and carriage returns
  are replaced with a space
- **Extension values**: equals signs (`=`) and backslashes are escaped;
  newlines are escaped to the literal two-character sequence `\n` and
  carriage returns to `\r`
- Control characters (0x00-0x1F) are stripped from extension values

**Note:** Spaces in CEF extension values are not escaped — spaces are
the key=value pair separator in the CEF specification. Avoid embedding
literal spaces in field values intended for CEF output; use underscores
or structured identifiers at the application level.
